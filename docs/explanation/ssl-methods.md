# Self-Supervised Learning Methods

This section explains the self-supervised learning methods implemented in Tabular SSL.

## Overview

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm where models learn from unlabeled data by creating their own supervision signals. In Tabular SSL, we implement several SSL methods:

1. **Masked Feature Prediction**
2. **Contrastive Learning**
3. **Feature Reconstruction**

## Masked Feature Prediction

### How It Works

1. **Feature Masking**
   - Randomly mask a portion of features
   - Use a masking ratio (default: 0.15)
   - Preserve feature relationships

2. **Prediction Task**
   - Predict masked features
   - Use surrounding features as context
   - Learn feature dependencies

### Implementation

```python
from tabular_ssl import TabularSSL

model = TabularSSL(
    input_dim=10,
    mask_ratio=0.15  # 15% of features masked
)

# Train with masked feature prediction
history = model.train(
    data=train_data,
    ssl_method='masked_prediction'
)
```

## Contrastive Learning

### How It Works

1. **Data Augmentation**
   - Create positive pairs
   - Apply transformations
   - Generate negative samples

2. **Contrastive Loss**
   - Maximize similarity of positive pairs
   - Minimize similarity of negative pairs
   - Learn robust representations

### Implementation

```python
from tabular_ssl import TabularSSL

model = TabularSSL(
    input_dim=10,
    ssl_method='contrastive'
)

# Train with contrastive learning
history = model.train(
    data=train_data,
    temperature=0.07,  # Temperature parameter
    queue_size=65536   # Size of memory queue
)
```

## Feature Reconstruction

### How It Works

1. **Autoencoder Architecture**
   - Encode input features
   - Decode to reconstruct
   - Learn feature representations

2. **Reconstruction Loss**
   - Minimize reconstruction error
   - Learn feature relationships
   - Capture data structure

### Implementation

```python
from tabular_ssl import TabularSSL

model = TabularSSL(
    input_dim=10,
    ssl_method='reconstruction'
)

# Train with feature reconstruction
history = model.train(
    data=train_data,
    reconstruction_weight=1.0
)
```

## Combining Methods

### Multi-Task Learning

```python
from tabular_ssl import TabularSSL

model = TabularSSL(
    input_dim=10,
    ssl_methods=['masked_prediction', 'contrastive']
)

# Train with multiple SSL methods
history = model.train(
    data=train_data,
    method_weights={
        'masked_prediction': 0.5,
        'contrastive': 0.5
    }
)
```

## Method Selection

### When to Use Each Method

1. **Masked Feature Prediction**
   - When feature relationships are important
   - For structured tabular data
   - When interpretability is needed

2. **Contrastive Learning**
   - For robust representations
   - When data augmentation is possible
   - For transfer learning

3. **Feature Reconstruction**
   - For simple feature learning
   - When computational efficiency is important
   - For basic representation learning

## Best Practices

### Method Selection

1. **Data Characteristics**
   - Consider data structure
   - Evaluate feature relationships
   - Assess data quality

2. **Task Requirements**
   - Define learning objectives
   - Consider downstream tasks

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Consider memory usage
   - Evaluate training time
   - Assess hardware requirements

### Implementation Tips

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Masking ratio
   - Temperature parameter
   - Loss weights

2. **Training Strategy**
